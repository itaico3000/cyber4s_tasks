                        The <strong>avocado</strong> (Persea americana) is a

                        partially self-pollinating, and are often propagated
                        through grafting to maintain predictable fruit quality

                        of avocados in 2019, supplying 32% of the world total.
                        The fruit of domestic varieties has a buttery flesh when
                        ripe. Depending on the variety, avocados have green,
                        brown, purplish, or black skin when ripe, and may be
                        pear-shaped, egg-shaped, or spherical. Commercially, the
                        fruits are picked while immature, and ripened after
                        harvesting.

                        Persea americana is a tree that grows to 20 m (66 ft),
                        with alternately arranged leaves 12–25 cm (5–10 in)
                        long. Panicles of flowers with deciduous bracts arise
                        from new growth or the axils of leaves.The flowers are
                        inconspicuous, greenish-yellow, 5–10 mm (3⁄16–3⁄8 in)
                        wide. The species is variable because of selection
                        pressure by humans to produce larger, fleshier fruits
                        with a thinner exocarp. The avocado fruit is a
                        climacteric, single-seeded berry, due to the
                        imperceptible endocarp covering the seed, rather than a

                        evidence suggests similar species were much more
                        widespread millions of years ago. However, there is
                        evidence for three possible separate domestications of
                        the avocado, resulting in the currently recognized
                        Mexican (aoacatl), Guatemalan (quilaoacatl), and West
                        Indian (tlacacolaocatl) landraces. The Mexican and
                        Guatemalan landraces originated in the highlands of
                        those countries, while the West Indian landrace is a
                        lowland variety that ranges from Guatemala, Costa Rica,
                        Colombia, Ecuador to Peru, achieving a wide range
                        through human agency before the arrival of the
                        Europeans. The three separate landraces were most likely
                        to have already intermingled in pre-Columbian America
                        and were described in the Florentine Codex. The earliest
                        residents of northern coastal Peru were living in
                        temporary camps in an ancient wetland and eating
                        avocados, along with chilies, mollusks, sharks, birds,
                        and sea lions. The oldest discovery of an avocado pit
                        comes from Coxcatlan Cave, dating from around 9,000 to
                        10,000 years ago. Other caves in the Tehuacan Valley
                        from around the same time period also show early
                        evidence for the presence and consumption of avocado.
                        There is evidence for avocado use at Norte Chico
                        civilization sites in Peru by at least 3,200 years ago
                        and at Caballo Muerto in Peru from around 3,800 to 4,500
                        years ago.
